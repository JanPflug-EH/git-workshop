# Workshop Advanced Git


## Understanding Git


Using some of the more advanced techniques in git requires some understanding of how git works internally.


### Commit Graph* and *Object Store*

> Inspect the commit 35ac61b in the object store
> without using porcelaine commands, like `show`, `log`, `checkout`, ...
>
> Navigate to the file `branches/index.md` an show its content.

```
    $ git cat-file -p 35ac61b
    $ git cat-file -p 37a149d # tree
    $ git cat-file -p b74bfac # tree of branches
    $ git cat-file -p 26a3cd1a # content of file
```

> There is a special kind of entry in the root commit,
> Whiche line look unusual?

```
 $ git cat-file -p b4db3f6
 $ git cat-file -p 6d01263
...
160000 commit 249f0139598b20d02263b81a76f1ff87f8e74225  revealjs
...
   What does commit mean here?
```

> Now inspect the oldest merge in this repo

```
 $ git cat-file -p 2bd9289

tree aa642b5e0eebb4df9a6ff4f15c908c00060a9eda
parent 328dafaa41e4ebf748c84143f1f683bb88b068d9
parent 14d997ac6f82535efd26d016b5516a7d10f2fb31
```

 1. Two parent entries
 1. A normal complete tree
    - this can be an arbitrary tree
    - does not have to resamble any of its parents


 * *Refs* - Understand how Branches work
   - *Refs* are the implementation behind branches, remote branches and tag.
     Understanding them help to manage branches, perform repository maintenance,


> Prepare this:
> `$ git clone --bare git@gitlab.com:gitlab-ci-samples/basic-job.git`
> `$ git clone basic-job.git`
> Create and checkout a new local branch `my-local-branch` at one commit below `just-a-branch`
> (This show point at `38295db Add some important line`)
>
> Now try to push this back to the `origin` (the bare repo)
> Check the commit graph in `origin`

```
 $ git push origin +my-local-branch:just-a-branch
```

> Now try to use a mirror-Clone to reset both `master` and `just-a-branch` by one commit.
> Check the result in the commit graph in `origin`

```
 $ git clone --mirror basic-job.git basic-job.mirror
 $ cd basic-job.mirror
 $ git branch -f just-a-branch just-a-branch~1
 $ git branch -f master master~1
 $ git push # hope, you know what you're doing
```


 * Synchronization
   - Understanding how and what git transfers between clones
     is helpful when dealing with performance issues.


Practical exercises:


 * Inspection of the *commit graph* and the *refs* in a real (open source) project
 * Accessing of objects in the *object store*
 * Inspection of the changes in a repo after a *fetch* operation.




## Tips & Tricks


This section introduceds some less know but useful features
and a few best practices for for the day to daw work with git.


 * Usage of worktrees for a more efficient local workflow.
 * The power of stashing
 * Using git to assist debugging (local tags, bisection, fine-grained commits)


Practical exercises:


 * Just try out some the features.




## Deep Dive - Merging


Merge conflicts: Strategies for avoiding, handling and debugging merge problems.


 * What is a merge? (Commit Graph)
 * Automatic merging: How do the standard merge algorithms work.
 * Examples for a non standard-merging
   - Using subtree merges
 * Reverting merges: Git makes it easy to merge. It can be harder to undo a merge that has already been pushed.


Practical exercises:


 * Solving some example of merges with increasing difficulty




## Deep Dive - Rebasing


 * Rebasing basics: How does it work? How to use it and when to avoid it.
   - Dangers of rebasing
 * Workflows using rebasing (trunk based, feature branching)
 * Related Operations: Commit
 * Using interactive rebasing to prepare a code review
 * Advanced rebasing techniques: Usages of  rebase, cherry-pick, squash merges, filter-branch, BFG etc.  How to improve the quality of reviews with interactive rebasing.


Practical exercises:


 * Perform an interactive rebase on a sequence of multiple commits




## Structuring and Restructuring Projects


 * Structuring modules with submodules
 * Structuring modules with subtreee


Practical exercises:


 * Using the subtree command
   - Combine two repos into one
   - Extract a module
