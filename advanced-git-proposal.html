# Workshop Advanced Git


## Understanding Git


Using some of the more advanced techniques in git requires some understanding of how git works internally.


 * *Commit Graph* and *Object Store*
   - Understanding how git stores data helps to understand
     merging strategies, rebasing and features like submodules, subtrees
     or LFS.


 * *Refs* - Understand how Branches work
   - *Refs* are the implementation behind branches, remote branches and tag.
     Understanding them help to manage branches, perform repository maintenance,


 * Synchronization
   - Understanding how and what git transfers between clones
     is helpful when dealing with performance issues.


Practical exercises:


 * Inspection of the *commit graph* and the *refs* in a real (open source) project
 * Accessing of objects in the *object store*
 * Inspection of the changes in a repo after a *fetch* operation.




## Tips & Tricks


This section introduceds some less know but useful features
and a few best practices for for the day to daw work with git.


 * Usage of worktrees for a more efficient local workflow.
 * The power of stashing
 * Using git to assist debugging (local tags, bisection, fine-grained commits)


Practical exercises:


 * Just try out some the features.




## Deep Dive - Merging


Merge conflicts: Strategies for avoiding, handling and debugging merge problems.


 * What is a merge? (Commit Graph)
 * Automatic merging: How do the standard merge algorithms work.
 * Examples for a non standard-merging
   - Using subtree merges
 * Reverting merges: Git makes it easy to merge. It can be harder to undo a merge that has already been pushed.


Practical exercises:


 * Solving some example of merges with increasing difficulty




## Deep Dive - Rebasing


 * Rebasing basics: How does it work? How to use it and when to avoid it.
   - Dangers of rebasing
 * Workflows using rebasing (trunk based, feature branching)
 * Related Operations: Commit
 * Using interactive rebasing to prepare a code review
 * Advanced rebasing techniques: Usages of  rebase, cherry-pick, squash merges, filter-branch, BFG etc.  How to improve the quality of reviews with interactive rebasing.


Practical exercises:


 * Perform an interactive rebase on a sequence of multiple commits




## Structuring and Restructuring Projects


 * Structuring modules with submodules
 * Structuring modules with subtreee


Practical exercises:


 * Using the subtree command
   - Combine two repos into one
   - Extract a module
